# pNISE
A parallelized NISE algorithm applied toward biobjective shortest path analysis on raster grids used in Medrano & Church (2015)

## Contents
Contains both a graphical implementation using Processing, and a non-graphical but faster implementation in Java. Data is included in both.

**Requirements**  
[Processing](https://processing.org/): last tested with v3.5.3  
Java SDK: last tested with Java SE 8 Update 66  
*update contributions are welcome*
