# pNISE with EISPC Data
This folder contains screen captures of the results of numerous bi-objective shortest path analyses using the pNISE parallel algorithm on the EISPC data set. The filename specifies:
* the lower bound of the classification
* the upper bound of the classification
* the radius (r-value) of the underlying network

**IMPORTANT NOTE**  
The images were captured using numerous computers, so the reported computation times should not be used for benchmarking.
